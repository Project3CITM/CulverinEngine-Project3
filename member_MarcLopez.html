                        We started this project based on three "game pillars" given by our publisher, Ricard Pillosu, which marked the nature of our game. These were "Accessible Dungeon Crawler", "GoT feel (TV Series)" and three re-playable levels with specific objectives, using as a game of reference "The Legend of Grimrock II".
                        With this information we draw up an action plan in which we create a pipeline of creation and implementation of game mechanics, levels and puzzles.

                        Capture is about doing research work in several areas, not only in video games. For example, we use the television series as reference material to then design levels and create characters in the same way that we look for historical information about medieval troops to create enemies.
                        Of course, video games are a very important aspect in this process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We used as main source "The Legend of Grimrock II" but it was not the only one, we also took other games of the same genre as reference, like "One more Dungeon".
                        The objective this this part of the process was not only to play the games but to study them. See as a series of problems, why solution had chosen each game. So, we can observe the common denominator factor and take that solution, not necessarily try to reinvent the wheel with one of our own.
                        In the same way look if you can improve that solution and how to do so.

                    <p>
                        Brainstorming is the stage of the process where we apply all this knowledge acquired in the previous one and transform it into new ideas to implement in our game. First, we start with an idealization with very broad limits and then close them as the stage progresses, given that every game has limits and we have to decide where our own will be.

                        From this we would enter an iterative circle that will be repeated for much of the development of our game. Specifically, in our case it was until the end of Alpha 2.
                        Prototyping consists of making a quick and slightly polished version to get an idea of how it would be in the game and whether it would work or not. For example, for the puzzle of pressure plates, we created a version on this board and tested it to see its viability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After prototyping we coordinate with both programming and art departments to analyze the technical feasibility of this proposal. If the approval is given by both departments, the cycle would continue, and if this were not the case, a common point would be sought for the three departments and the prototype would be reformed.
                    </p>

                        <br>In this stage we test those prototypes to see which ones work and which ones do not. The main testing process used to be internal, although we have also done external. <br><br>After the explanation of this pipeline I will go into more detail about these processes, but we were looking for ways to answer questions like "What did you like about this prototype? What not? What would you change? And so on.

                    <h4>Iterate & Implement</h4>
                    <a name="Iterate"></a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When we iterate a prototype after the testing phase we look for what can be changed and what should be changed. Also, what kind of changes we make and test.
                        This stage takes us back to the prototype again, where we would build an improved version of the last one based on the feedback received during the playtest and then iterate again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After carrying out this process repeatedly, we arrive at a state where we have an updated version of the game ready to be implemented, a process that when we finish we launch a release open to the public to try it out.
                        The implementation does not mean that this element will not be iterated anymore. If during the testing sessions, both internal and external, it was shown that there were important flaws, this feature would return to the iterative circle once again in order to improve it.

                    <p>
                        In our game the most common process of testing was internal. We chose this method as a priority for two reasons. First one, was the limited public to which we could go as external testers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Second one, is because the span of the milestones, these were an average of two weeks apart so that having to perform all the steps mentioned above, left little time to collect and discern among all the external feedback received which was useful to improve our game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even so, we have conducted external testing sessions when our game was in a more mature state and we wanted feedback on its status in general.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The internal testing of our game was a continuous process, through which each scrum group tested the parts they had created and implemented, with higher intensity peaks where the implementation of new features would be paused, so that the entire team could focus on testing all the aspects of the game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To collect the maximum amount of information possible during internal and external testing sessions, we created a questionnaire with various questions about the game that the testers had to answer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then we classified those answers according to three categories. Those that reported "bugs" we passed them to Github Issues and were assigned to the relevant teams and people to be fixed, those that dealt with design flaws (for instance, the combat against this enemy is very frustrating or this skill feels useless ) and those that made proposals on which we could not do anything about it (for example, asking for a greater repertoire of enemies or characters) due to time constraints.

                <p>
                    First, I want to say that this has been our first "big project" as a design team, not only as a group but for each one of us as well.
                    We started with grand expectations about our game, likewise the level and amount of content that we could implement, so 75% of the design initially created has not been implemented into the final game.
                </p>
				    <p>
                    A very important factor has been the fact that we started simultaneously the development of the engine, the GDD and the game. This caused that when the programmers needed the design documents to be able to carry out the necessary tasks, they had a lower quality than the desired one, in order to accelerate the creation process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the Discovery concept to the Beta, the design department has undergone several changes and has been subject to continuous evolution thanks to the knowledge we acquired as the project progressed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, what were the causes for this event to happen?
                </p>        
                <p>
                    There is a lengthy list of arguments why this situation has happened, but now I would like to focus on those that have had the most impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First one was not knowing how to properly measure the implementation time for each feature. For example, we started conceptualizing the design of a total of 8 maps and theorized the creation of several progression systems. But as the project progressed we saw that its implementation was not possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Second, we lacked initiative in some areas of the game and active collaboration with programming and art departments. We believe that is the design team responsibility to propose a direction in which the game should go and to know how to find consensus among the other teams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This has not been done always during the development of our game, which has spontaneously caused an internal clash that has subsequently been detrimental to the number of features that we have been able to implement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Third, related to the first point where I commented that we underestimated the implementation time of each feature, we did not consider the bottlenecks that could be generated during the development. Our team consists of a total of 7 artists, 4 designers and 19 programmers, excluding the leaders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This caused that, in the first iterations of design, especially the art department had an excessive workload, due to the size of the team, causing a bottleneck and slowing down the development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fourth and last, during the development of "Unthrone" 2 of the 6 initial members of the design team left the project. This caused the need to cut even more the amount of elements that we could implement. I tried to alleviate the situation by including myself within the scenario scrum team, looking to replace their work, but that had a side effect in my job as the leader of the design team.
                </p>
				    
                <p>
                    Even so, I think it was a necessary decision where the benefits outweighed the inconveniences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also mention that during the development there have been situations in which the described pipeline has not been respected, and although in the short term it had benefits such as reducing the implementation time in the game, in the medium and long term it had damages given that many of these implementations were added then they negatively impacted the game.
                </p>
				<div class="span12">
                    <img class="thumbnail" style="max-height: 400px;max-width: 400px; margin: 0 auto;" src="img/member-images/ML_Success.png" alt="" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    That said, from the design department we have also achieved some merits during the development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, we have successfully implemented several puzzles. Although the first iteration of these failed we knew how to straighten and redirect the situation with a second iteration in which we finished very satisfied with the obtained result.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also believe that a good job has been done in the level design department, creating interesting levels with the assets that we had available. In the same way, there has been a positive evolution of our combat system with respect to the first iterations, ending with a correct result and an interesting final Boss.
                </p>
					In short, we started covering more content than we could do and that was one of the reasons why we had to rethink our design when we reached the midpoint of development, causing a reduction in the final content of the game, but we knew how to rectify the situation positively, achieving a satisfactory result.

                       Now I would like to talk about my work as a leader in the design department. Apart from the creation of the pipeline to implement new content to our game, I have been in charge of several other areas during the development of Unthrone.
                    </p>
					 <p>
                       My goal as a leader was to seek the best possible performance of our team while maintaining a healthy work environment. To fulfill this milestone, I sought to know in depth the members that formed this team, so when I had to create and distribute the necessary design tasks, I could assign the most suitable member for each one of them.

                    I worked with the entire design team in the initial conception of the game. Although we had certain parameters defined by our Publisher, Ricard Pillosu, as well as other games references, there were many decisions to be made regarding many other aspects of the game such as; What combat system would we use? Or what kind of movement would we have?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although many of these issues were solved as the development progressed, the initial group work was crucial to start our game and decide the "Core" Gameplay.

						One of the most important parts of which I have been in charge has been the creation and assignment of design tasks during the start of development. These consisted of a detailed description of the purpose of the task, as well as the steps that had to be followed to complete it. I've also create several templates on how to complete these tasks in order to solve any issues that designers may have had.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We started using Trello as an organization tool for these tasks, although later we changed to HacknPlan, and Slack as a communication tool.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Later, when we adopted the scrum methodology, I entrusted myself with the other leaders in the creation of these teams, as well as the assignment of scrum masters for each one of them. Then the scrum masters created the tasks, which were reviewed by me with the aim of ensuring that their requirements were adequate in terms of design. In most of these tasks this step included adding a description and steps on how to do it in the same way as the tasks created during the start of the development.

						The most important section of the tasks was its correction, given that once this step was completed the document was considered completed, and was used as a reference for work by the other development teams.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The correction included several steps. When the designers had finished the task, I was notified by the tool that we were using (Trello or HacknPlan) at that moment and then proceed with the correction. This step was carried out in two ways, if the designer or I didn't coincide during the course of the action, this consisted in adding comments, questions and changes to the document. Then it was sent back to the designer to modify it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If we could arrange an hour to carry out the correction process it was done either in person or online and we were reviewing the entire document discussing the reason for each decision that the designer in question had taken.

						Apart from the use of the scrum methodology as a way of working, I have been in charge of organizing the meetings of the design department, as well as establishing the points that should be dealt with. These meetings were almost daily during the start of project development when the design load was higher.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Looking at it in perspective, one mistake I made was not to make more constant meetings when we started using the scrum methodology and the project went on. Although it is true that each group attended their meetings autonomously, in which I also participated, the absence of specifically design meetings caused confusion and ignorance within the design team about the work performed by each one of the members.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It also caused that the follow-up was not so constant on each of the members of the design team, so delays arose in some of their tasks in the middle of the development.

					One of the concepts, that I worked on during the beginning of the development of our game, was which classes would constitute it. Although later, after the restructuring of the design upon reaching the middle of the development cycle, many of the elements of this class system were deprecated, I would like to explain what it consisted of.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our game was based on that each one of the characters began with an initial base class, this could be Healer, Tank or Sniper. Then as the course of the game progressed this class could be specialized in three different ways through a system of talents that gave it new skills or improvements to the existing ones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first two forms led to the other two roles, i.e a Healer could specialize in Tank or Sniper while a Tank could do it in a Healer or a Sniper creating a hybrid between both classes. One distinction we had was the fact that the class you started with marked which ones you could reach, so that a Tank that went towards a healing branch would never be the same as a Healer going to the Tank one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The third way was to focus on the same class by enhancing the skills inherent in it. If a healer carried out this process he would get more powerful spells and abilities to perform that function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The previous image explains it, in a more understandable way, all the combos we had.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Of the final characters that we ended up having in our game, I've worked on Jaime's alongside Aleix Cardona. I was mainly responsible for conceptualizing the main skill, the support one and looking for references for each one of the animations that had to be done so that the artists could then carry them out.

                </p>
				<p>
					From the mid-point in the development of our project, I had a great involvement in the level design department of our game, entering the stage scrum group and assuming the functions of a level designer.
                </p>
				<div class="span12">
                        <img class="thumbnail" style="max-height: 600px;max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto;" src="img/member-images/ML_DesignLevel.png" alt="" />
                    </div>
                <p>
                    My job in this department was to design the first and only level for our first Alpha. At that point the idea was to have three different levels in King's Landing for the final product, but one of them was removed due to time constraints. The idea behind the design of this level is that the player had a guided experience from the start all the way up through defeating the first enemy and overcome puzzle. Then he would be at the epicenter of the map where he would have two possible paths, which he should explore in order to be able to advance and complete the level.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This level was then separated into three smaller ones, in Alpha 2, to alleviate load times and improve performance at certain critical points of the map where the accumulation of lights and polygons was higher.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was also in charge of implementing a large part of the first level after its redesign done by Sebastián Delgado for Alpha 2. I implemented parts 1 and 3 of it, while the second one was done alongside Daniel Olóndriz, our Lead Artist.

					And last but not least, I would like to mention that I have worked on the resolution of bugs in our game, as well as assigning the corresponding ones to the design department to each of their members. I have also collaborated in other small sections of the project such as the creation of the skeleton of the readme, as well as filling the information related to the design of Unthrone. Also skills iteration of the playable characters and the animations of the NPC enemies. And worked alongside some programmers to create new tools in our engine for the design team.
